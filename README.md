<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ðŸ’» About The Project
The project consists of reading a file that contains a matrix, which represents a graph. From its reading, certain information about the graph is displayed.

![app](https://github.com/antuniooh/graphs-calculator/blob/master/images/example.png)

The program reads the user-selected text file that contains an adjacency matrix of the graph.

**1 - Simple graph** - Displays if the graph referring to the adjacency matrix of the file is simple. Remembering that a simple graph is one that does not have multiple edges or loops.

**2 - Degree Sequence** - Displays the graph's sequence of degrees in non-ascending order. Remembering that a degree of a vertex is the number of edges that fall on it.

**3 - Number of Edges** - Displays the number of edges in the graph.

**4 - Regular Graph** - Displays whether the graph is regular or not. Since a graph is said to be regular when all its vertices have the same degree

**5 - Bipartite Graph** - Displays if the graph in question is bipartite and if so, it also displays its vertex bipartitions. A graph is said to be bipartite when its set of vertices V can be partitioned into two subsets X and Y, such that every edge of G joins a vertex of X to another of Y.

**6 - Complete Bipartite Graph** - Informs if the graph is complete bipartite. Remembering that a complete bipartite graph occurs when it is possible to divide into two partitions and with every vertex of one being adjacent to every vertex of the other partition.

<!-- HOW TO RUN -->
## ðŸš€ How To Run
